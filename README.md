# Universe on Ubuntu Chef Cookbook

v0.2.0 (In Development)

The Universe on Ubuntu cookbook creates a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04LTS
or 14.04LTS as operating system and configures all environment needed to make
it possible to use [OpenAI Universe](https://universe.openai.com/) as a software
platform to measure and train Artificial Intelligence on an extremely wide range
of real-time, complex and heterogeneous environments.

## Attributes

    default['universe']['gpu'] = false

The **GPU** attribute is set to `false` by default enabling only **CPU** processing.  
In order to enable **GPU** processing you should change the **GPU** attribute to `true`.  
When GPU attribute is enabled the recipe installs a different version of TensorFlow
plus CUDA and CuDNN libraries.  
> *TensorFlow GPU support requires having a GPU card with NVidia
Compute Capability (>= 3.0).

## Environment

The following packages are automatically installed:

- [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) (python 3.5)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and its modules
- [Universe](https://universe.openai.com/) and its modules
- [Universe Starter Agent](https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent)
(AC3 Algorithm)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 0.11
- [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- [Cuda toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 8.0 +
[CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) 5.1 (if you choose to enable GPU
  processing)

## Requirements

### Platforms
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Ubuntu 16.04

### Cookbooks
The following cookbooks are direct dependencies:
- apt '5.0'
- compat_resource

### Chef

- Chef 12.1+

## Recipes

This cookbook is split in 5 recipes in order to allow deployment on different setups and
make it easy to split the job between several machines in distributed environments:

- Essentials:  
Installs basic packages

- Tensorflow:  
Install Anaconda/Python environment and Tensorflow 0.11

- Cuda(Optional for GPU processing):  
Install Cuda Toolkit and CuDNN

- Docker:  
Install Docker

- OpenAI:  
Install Gym, Universe and Universe Starter Agent
